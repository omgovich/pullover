# Pullover — agent guide

Pullover is a macOS menu-bar Electron app: an inbox that shows only the pull requests waiting on you. Main-process code in `src/main/`, pure classification logic (fully unit-tested) in `src/core/`, React UI in `src/renderer/`.

Commands:

- `npm run dev` — run the app locally (needs `.env`, see README)
- `npm test` — unit tests
- `npm run typecheck` — type checking
- `npm run dist` — local unsigned build (`dist/*.dmg`)

Run `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` before committing.

Don't hard-wrap markdown files — one paragraph or list item per line.

## Releases

Everything happens in CI: pushing a `v*` tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds the dmgs into a draft GitHub release, writes the notes, and publishes it. To cut a release, from a clean synced `main`:

1. Bump `version` in `package.json` and commit as `Release v<X.Y.Z>`. Semver, judged by the commits since the last tag: user-visible change → minor, otherwise patch; a version named by the maintainer wins.
2. `git tag v<X.Y.Z> && git push origin main v<X.Y.Z>`.
3. Watch the run; when it's done, check the release looks right (`gh release view v<X.Y.Z>`) and report its URL.

If the run fails before anything was published, it's fine to delete the draft release and the tag, fix `main`, and re-tag the same version. Never move or reuse a tag or release that has been **published** — problems ship as the next version.
